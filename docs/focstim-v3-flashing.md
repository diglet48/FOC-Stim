# Soldering

* 4x transformers
* 4x 4mm bullet connectors (red, blue, yellow, green)
* 1x potmeter (optional)
* 1x jst-ph 2.0mm (optional, for battery. No reverse voltage protection!!!)

# Flashing the ESP32

All V3 boards I sent out came with the ESP32 firmware pre-programmed.


# Flashing the STM32 (serial)

Due to various hardware bugs, the STM32 crashes on boot. Extra steps are needed to boot normally or enter the bootloader.

**To enter the bootloader:** turn on the power, then briefly short the reset pin to ground.

In the bootloader, the following actions can be performed with the STM32CubeProgrammer CLI:

Erase the flash: `.\STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=COM4 -e all`

Program the firmware: `.\STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=COM4 -d firmware.elf`
(`.hex` also works. `.bin` does not work)

Start the firmware: `.\STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe -c port=COM4 -g 0x08000000`

Using the GUI to program the board will often fail.


**To start the board:** short the SCL / Boot0 pin to ground before flipping the power switch. If done succesfully, one of the LEDs will turn on.


# Flashing the STM32 (jtag debugger)

Ensure your V3 board has the required patches.

Upload the .elf firmware using your debug probe. I use segger J-Link with ozone debugger, but STM32CubeProgammer works too.

A hardware bug prevents the firmware from starting normally. Use one of these methods to start the firmware:
* Use the ozone debugger to 'reset program to main (F4)'.
* Short the SCL pin to ground, then reboot the board by shorting the reset pin or flip the power switch.
* Use STM32CubeProgrammer to set option bit `nSWBOOT` to 0. You can then boot the board normally. Only do this if you have a debug probe!


# Battery

To run the system from battery, the fuel gauge first needs to be programmed. The firmware does this on boot, provided you did not short SCL / Boot0 to ground.
