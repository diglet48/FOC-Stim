# Mainboard

Break off all the side rails, you can use some sandpaper to remove the sharp edges.

![](images/focstim-v4-side-rails.jpg)

Snip off the middle pins of the 4 transformers, bend the metal tabs in.

Solder the transformers to the unpopulated side of the board. The orientation is important!

Solder the battery connector and switch to the unpopulated side of the board.

> [!CAUTION]
> Not all batteries have the same pinout. Connecting a battery with the wrong pinout will
> destroy your board.

# Frontpanel

> [!NOTE]  
> Make sure to solder the frontpanel components to the correct side

> [!NOTE]  
> Follow this assembly order


Solder the SMD nuts to the rear of the frontpanel.

Apply some solder and then heat up the entire nut to flow into place. 
A good mechanical connection is important. When in doubt, a bit of solder
can be added on the other side.

Solder the 2.0mm connectors to the same side and test fit.

Solder the 2.54mm pins to the display.  
Place the display and frontpanel into the assembly fixture and solder the parts together.

Snip all pins of the display short (both sides) for clearance with the PCB and case.

Snip off the very corner of the display for clearance in the case.

Solder the encoder and you're done.

# Case

Print the case. No supports needed if printing at .2 layer height.

TODO: print instructions.

Install the M3 heatset inserts in the battery sled.

TOOD: image showing this assembly step.

Attach the feet.

TODO: wait for feet to arrive and make pictures

# Assembly

Insert the frontpanel into the case and tighten the 2mm banana jacks.
The best tool for grabbing onto the jacks is a small torx bit, just jam it into the hole.

The order is be red - blue - yellow - green.

Jacks should be a loose fit, if they are extremely tight you may delaminate the
frontpanel during tightening.

Combine the mainboard, battery tray and rear by sliding the parts together.   
Insert the battery connector and neatly fold the battery cable under. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not pinch the battery cable against the sharp edges of the switch.

Slide the whole assembly into the case. Tighten the single screw on the bottom to lock the assembly.

The extra holes can be used for a belt clip (todo: design).




# Disassembly

Remove the screws from the bottom. Shake the case and the mainboard should slide out.  
If this does not work you can push the board out with a small allen key through the 2mm jacks
or by driving a long M4 bolt into one of the holes.

Remove the 2mm jacks with a small torx bit.
