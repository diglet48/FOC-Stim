# Core parts:

Ordering on mouser is recommended because the transformer is very difficult to find elsewhere.

* 1x Control board
  * B-G431B-ESC1 [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/STMicroelectronics/B-G431B-ESC1?qs=%252B6g0mu59x7KUfhaFDGurZQ%3D%3D)


* 3x transformer
  * xicon 42TU200-RC [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/42TU200-RC)
  * If not in stock, 42TU400-RC can be used as a substitute.
  * If neither are available, look for audio transformers with winding ratio around 10, secondary resistance as low as possible. For safety, it is important not to choose transformers that are significantly larger than the xicon parts.


* 3x inductor
  * Fastron 09HCP-221M or 09HVP-221M [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/Fastron/09HCP-221M-50?qs=igiTrb5Y5PMDjMomTeh8Hg%3D%3D)
  * Kemet SBCP-11HY221H. 80HY or 14HY series also possible [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/KEMET/SBCP-11HY221H?qs=pfd5qewlna6%252BrMZ%252BQtyB1g%3D%3D)
  * Coilcraft RFB1010-221L [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/Coilcraft/RFB1010-221L?qs=ZYnrCdKdyecpj3R4Spi0Qw%3D%3D)
  * Coilcraft RFS1317-224KL [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/Coilcraft/RFS1317-224KL?qs=W38ilblRkRlSN%2FG2x%2FRvWA%3D%3D)
  * If neither are available, look for: inductance 180-470µH (220µH preferred), saturation current >1A minimum >1.3A preferred, flat inductance-current curve in the datasheet.


* 3x capacitor
  * FG18X5R1E106MRT06 [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/TDK/FG18X5R1E106MRT06?qs=LtAzLad%252BoeWpVdbzeG4%252B8Q%3D%3D)
  * Many other options available. Must be ceramic, look for 4.7µH-10µH (10µH preferred), >25v



# Misc parts

Easy to find locally. You might not need all of these components.

* power supply
  * 12v 0.5A minimum, 1A preferred.
  * Most common is DC barrel jack, 5.5 x 2.1 mm.
  * A double-insulated power supply (two squares symbol) is highly recommended for safety.
  * For most users a voltage above 12v is excessive, but the board can be powered with a higher voltage if you need more power. Minimum voltage is 10v.


* DC barrel jack
  * part ???


* Power switch
  * part ???


* Linear potmeter, 10k
  * Original pot on the board has to be removed.
  * Bourns PDB181-E420K-103B [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/Bourns/PDB181-E420K-103B?qs=Ivs1Be2ZGq51QiDv8T3bpQ%3D%3D)

* USB micro-B cable
  * You probably already have one


* USB micro-B panel mount
  * SparkFun CAB-15464 [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/SparkFun/CAB-15464?qs=XeJtXLiO41TW%252BnYEDtaNzg%3D%3D)
  * iJiZuo USB C to Micro USB Adapter [amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B0B7RMFMN4/)


* general soldering supplies
  * Soldering iron
  * bunch of cable 1A rated, such as 20AWG.
  * protoboard such as Adafruit 2670 [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/Adafruit/2670?qs=XAKIUOoRPe7ATe8H6FaFPg%3D%3D)


* Electrode connectors
  * My preference is 3x 4mm banana connectors, but some use 3.5mm audio jacks.
  * Banana connectors: ???
  * audio jack: [mouser](https://mouser.com/ProductDetail/Same-Sky/SJ5-43502PM?qs=WyjlAZoYn52%252BIiPG9eebPg%3D%3D)
